{"name":"On Available Corpora for Empirical Methods in Vision & Language","tagline":"","body":"## **1. Introduction**\r\n\r\nIntegrating vision and language has long been a dream in work on artificial intelligence (AI).\r\nIn the past two years, we have witnessed an explosion of work that brings together vision and language from images to videos and beyond.\r\nThe available corpora have played a crucial role in advancing this area of research.\r\nIn this paper we propose a set of quality metrics for evaluating and analyzing the vision-&-language datasets and classify them accordingly.\r\nOur analyses show that the most recent datasets have been using more complex language.\r\n\r\n## **2.

Blog data: They crawled 53,091 unique blog posts and 128,563 pictures from blogspot, wordpress, and typepad by querying Google. Then park experts manually classified the blog posts into three groups: Travelogue, Disney and Junk. The Travelogue category is the one describing stories and events with multiple images in Disneyland, which is the focus of this work.\r\nThis dataset can be used for joint alignment of photo streams and blogs, where each can help the other for summarization and exploration.\r\n \r\n  - Gunhee Kim, Seungwhan Moon, Leonid Sigal.\r\n    *Joint Photo Stream and Blog Post Summarization and Exploration.*\r\n    28th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.\r\n    [[PDF]](http://cs.brown.edu/~ls/Publications/cvpr2015_blogstory.pdf)\r\n\r\n<!-- Do it later\r\n## **5.
